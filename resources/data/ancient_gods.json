      "story": "Ra wanted to teach the people he made how to live. So he took on the shape of a man and became the first pharaoh, king of Egypt. Since Ra was now in the form of a man, he could no longer stay young forever. He was bound to grow old one day. After ruling Egypt for many thousands of years, that time finally came. At his old age, Ra began to notice that his people no longer respected him. They laughed at him. They mocked him. They said, \"Look at Ra! Ra is so old! His bones are like silver, his flesh like gold, and his hair the color of lapis lazuli!\" They also said, We cant go on like this. We need a new leader.",
